# Homework / Module 01

## Description

Made client index.html page more accessible by adding semantic HTML elements, fixing broken links, and adding alt text to images.
CSS was refactored to mirror newly stuctured HTML, with appropriate comments added. Increased accessability will help people with disabilities view the webpage, as well as protect the client against litigation issues.
